# Split
Split is an phone app designed to cultivate saving habits. In addition to its basic accounting functions, it encourages users to engage with friends and family. We've implemented a shared wallet feature, allowing users to share accounting information within the wallet. This feature is suitable for use among family members or couples.

In scenarios where a group of people dine together and one person pays initially, followed by a need to split the bill, our app not only allows users to decide how to split the bill within the app but also provides a built-in spinner to randomly assign the responsibility as a fun game element.

To further incentivize users to actively manage their shared wallet, we offer a check-in system. By regularly managing their accounts, users have the chance to earn special cards, each with unique functions such as assigning someone to cover certain expenses. These features enhance interaction among members within the wallet group."
